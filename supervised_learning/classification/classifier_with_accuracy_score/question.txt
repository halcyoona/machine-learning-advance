Using the badge.data dataset,

try different parameters with count and tfidf vectorizers i.e., max features, min_df etc.

try different classifiers e.g., linear, knn etc.

try different parameters for each classifier i.e., no. of neighbors or max_depth etc.

Use train_test_split of 0.7 for training and 0.3 for testing with shuffle as True

Report:

Code and Accuracy scores of your three best models i.e., giving highest accuracy.
